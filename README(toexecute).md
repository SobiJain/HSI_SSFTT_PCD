1. Run the colab file present in this https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1PQeOSm24Op_Pmb1UuoPSDVi7-I9Rl-6_ folder using the mtp830 google account.
2. In the last cell, two python files' name is mentioned, one is commented out. Uncomment one of them at a time to run the required model.
3. The file's whose name is mentioned in the last cell of the colab notebook is the same file where you can edit the dataset, patch size, train test raio etc.
4. To replicate the results, first run all the cells except the last cell, the make changes like train test ratio, dataset path etc then run the last cell also, the code will be executed.
5. Classification maps will be stored (for the duration of the runtime only) in the classification_maps folder.
6. For DCT model, the results are saved in cls_result and for the SSFTT model for pcb datasets, the results are saved in cls_facto folder (again only for the duration of the runtime only).
7. To save the results/images permanentlt download them from the colab menu itself, before the runtime gets terminated.
